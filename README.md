# What you will need:
- Replit or Visual Code Studios
- Discord Server
- Discord Bot
- (If you don't know how to get any of these join my Discord.)

# How to:
- Go to "Mines.py"
- Click "Raw"
- Copy the code
- Go to Replit or Visual Code Studios
- Paste the code on the file

# You will make these changes:
- In the very last line where it says "bot.run('token'), you will:
- Visual Code Studios : delete the 'token' and paste in you bot's token.
- Replit (Premium) : delete the 'token' and paste in your bot's token.
- Replit (Free) : delete the '' and go to the left side and click the lock. Put in 'TOKEN' as the key without the '' and put in your bot's token as the value. Then you will click the 'Insert' under the 'Add the imports'. And then you will click the 'Insert' under the 'Access by key as an environment variable' and make sure it's above the bot.run(token). Lastly you will change the my_secret in 'my_secret = os.environ['TOKEN']' into token instead.

# After all of that, you will now click the "Run" button, and make sure you added the bot first before using the commands.

# To Use the the command, you will type in .mines 'your round id'. Do not add the ''.
